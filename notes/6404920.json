I mean sure you won't do as much damage as a Kensai, but you won't turn around and rape your party when you fail your saving throw on a  mind control spell and you won't get mazed\/imprisoned by liches and you won't get turned into a drooling retard by magic mushrooms. It's just way too good to pass up. And besides, an extra 20-25 damage per round does NOT \"add up\" late game.
